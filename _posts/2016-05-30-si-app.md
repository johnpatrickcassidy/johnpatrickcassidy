# Overview
Outside of the weekly magazine app published to Newstand and Google Play, Sports Illustrated hasn't had a native app in the app store.

At the very time Sports Illustrated demo was getting older and older, it was becoming increasingly clear that SI was missing an opportunity to engage our key demographic of younger users.


# Kickoff

We kicked off the project on June 9, 2015 with a full day discovery and requirements gathering meeting. We reviewed competitor apps, did lighting demos of apps for inspiration with the goal of launching before the 2016 Super Bowl.
