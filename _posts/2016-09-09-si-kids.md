    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>The SI Kids website was badly outdated, particularly because it lacked a responsive design. Internal data and industry trends clearly signaled that usage rates were in decline as the brand’s core user base of kids aged out and a new generation of mobile-first (and sometimes -only) kids weren't visiting nearly as much anymore.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>A clean and simple mobile-first website at SIKids.com that sought to build renewed interest and engagement among core users</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h5 class="example">Lead Product Designer</h5>
      <p class="description">Due to tight timelines and resources constraints on our team, we reached out to the super-talented folks over at <a href="http://www.momentdesign.com/">Moment</a> to help out tear down and fully redesign <a href="http://www.sikids.com/">SIKids.com</a>. Throughout the process, I worked closely with Moment's team, collaborating with them on everything from discovery workshops to design reviews up until the final mockups.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Writing Some Code</h5>
      <p class="description">I was able to use SI Kids as a sandbox of sorts to — for the first time — meanifully start contributing code to the production codebase, enabling better and faster communication between the engineering and design teams.</p>
