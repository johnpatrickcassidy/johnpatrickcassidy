    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>The SI Kids website was badly outdated, particularly because it lacked a responsive design. Internal data and industry trends clearly signaled that usage rates were in decline as the brand’s core user base of kids aged out and a new generation of mobile-first (and sometimes -only) kids weren't visiting nearly as much anymore.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>A clean and simple mobile-first website at SIKids.com that sought to build renewed interest and engagement among core users</p>

      <h5 class="example">Lead Product Designer</h5>
      <p class="description">Due to tight timelines and resources constraints on our team, we reached out to the super-talented folks over at <a href="http://www.momentdesign.com/">Moment</a> to help out tear down and fully redesign <a href="http://www.sikids.com/">SIKids.com</a>. Throughout the process, I worked closely with Moment's team, collaborating with them on everything from discovery workshops to design reviews up until the final mockups.</p>

      <h5 class="example">High Fidelity Prototyping</h5>
      <p class="description">One of the trickest interaction design challenges in the app was the pinned game feature, and it's relationship to picture-in-picture video. Since static comps just wouldn't cut it here, I dove into Pixate to explore different directions in real-time on a device. Here's <a href="../assets/prototypes/pipCorners-04.pixate">the final prototype</a> to play around with.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Bridging the Engineering Gap</h5>
      <p class="description">I also led our design team's collaboration with our iOS and Android engineers. Due to our organizational structure, these engineers are part of a separate team. In the past, this often led to miscommunication and subpar products, so this time around I made sure to sit with them, check-in regularly, and most importantly, ask for their ideas and feedback as platform experts.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Sports Data Deep Dive</h5>
      <p class="description">Concurrently, I worked closely with our other engineering team that was creating a brand new sports data API. Throughout the product design and development process, I made sure to stay in close communication with them as we uncovered and accounted for all the sneaky edges cases that happen all too regularly across the major sport and leagues.</p>
