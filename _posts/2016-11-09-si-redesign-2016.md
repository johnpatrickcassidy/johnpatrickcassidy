    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>After relaunching SI.com in June 2014, users consistently reported the site to be cluttered, difficult to navigate, and slow. As part of the Sports Illustrated product team, we were eager to revamp the site to make it a best-in-class platform for sports content.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>We sought to design and build a fast, focused, sophisticated site where fans could experience Sports Illustrated's unique point of view and get the sports news they wanted everyday.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Articles</h5>
      <p class="description">The bread-and-butter of Sports Illustrated is its high quality sports journalism. Combine that with the web's ever-growing social and search traffic patterns, and we really wanted the articles to be constructed from beautiful, readable components.</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h5 class="example">Home Page & Section Fronts</h5>
      <p class="description">Though social & search traffic are increasing, Sports Illustrated still has many loyal users who visit the home page directly. Balancing user needs with editorial flexibility, all while making sure we met business requirements on ad inventory and viewability, became our primary challenge when designing components and layout logic for the home page.</p>

### Sports Data
While Sports Illustrated can't compete with the depth of sports data offered by the likes of ESPN, we know a significant segment of our users seek out scores, standings, and other statistics from us. Our goal was to present the data in as clean and straightforward way as possible.

### Photo Galleries
After several rounds of usability testing, coupled with analytics data from other sites within the company, we settled on vertical layout to showcase our great sports photography.

## My role

### User Research
I led the team's user research efforts, collaborating closely with the research department to create a comprehensive research strategy that included monthly usability lab sessions, a 3-week immersion-deprivation study, a focus group, and pre- and post-relaunch site intercept surveys.
For the usability sessions in particular, I spent a good bit of time thinking and tinkering with how we conducted the tests and shared the results. In the past, learnings gleaned from these studies were often ignored almost immediately. Experiments included:
* Writing notes on color-coded sticky notes (blue = positive, yellow = netural, red = negative) instead of tucked away in Google Docs or notebooks (thanks to the Sprint book for this one)
* Inviting members outside of the design team to actively participate in order to build up a shared understanding in real-time (instead of glazing over a written report generated a day or two later).
* Holding a debrief meeting immediately following the last session to discuss and priortize the key findings.
* Document the research in a shared space (for our team, this was in the wiki software Confluence) with links to the final report, pre-survey screener, task list, photos of the sticky notes, and full videos of each participant.

While there's still work to be done, user research did become much more ingrained in our process than ever before.

### Design & Engineering Collaboration
I worked to improve design & engineering collaboration by shifting the team's energy from static comps to spending more time deciding in the browser. I also spearheaded team workshops on content modeling, performance budgets, and shared naming conventions.

{% include image.html img="assets/img/projects/siRedesign/devDesignChats.jpg" title="" caption="" %}

I'd messed around Git before, but never in a way that allowed me to ship code to production consistently. So through a bit a trial-and-error and a whole lot of Stack Overflowing, I gradually familiarized myself with the command line (because c'mon, if you go Git, you need to go full Git CLI). There still tons I need to still learn but, and not that I'm competitive or anything, I'm currently sitting at 5th most code commits for the team in the new site's repo.

### Atomic Design Thinking
I pushed the team to think about building components outside the context of page layout in order think of them more in terms of extensible atomic units. I built the beginnings of a component library in Sketch in order to be able to evaluate the design system as a whole. It also helped us rapidly spin up prototypes for usability testing and stakeholder reviews.

### Design Critiques
We all know the pain of unhelpful design critiques, where the conversation veers off course and little gets accomplished. Time is wasted and egos get bruised.
Having sat through one too many of these, I could see a clear pattern emerging when critiques started to go awry—a lack of structure to the critique process.
So while leading this project, I experimented with critiques that set a clear goal at the outset and allowed the team some quiet time to review the work before the designer spoke.

{% include image.html img="assets/img/projects/siRedesign/designCritNav.jpg" title="" caption="" %}

While we continue to re-evaluate our design critiques, I think the product we shipped was better off for us injecting in a bit more structure into the process.








On August 16, 1954, Time Inc took a risk and added a new magazine title into its portfolio. Titled Sports Illustrated, it's mission was to cover the "Wonderful World of Sport."

Flash forward 62 years and see a history dotted with milestones. Unforgettable moments forever immortalized on its covers.

Pain, struggle, triumph, defeat. The words of sports…the words of our users?!?

*Add a few tweets from frustrated users*

Not only are our users struggling, but our key KPIs were suffering. Sports Illustrated has some of the best sports journalism, but the experience of reading wasn't up to par.

### The Process
On January 12, 2016, the core team gather to begin a full-on redesign of the site. For the next 12 weeks, our team would be working very closely with the fantastic team at [Moment](http://www.momentdesign.com/). [John Devanney](http://www.momentdesign.com/who-we-are/john-devanney), [Karmen Kaufmann](http://www.momentdesign.com/who-we-are/karmen-kaufmann), [Oje Ihonvbere](http://www.momentdesign.com/who-we-are/oje-ihonvbere).

* Definition phase
  * Current state analysis
  * Experience definition
  * Brief curation
* Concepting phase
  * Interface concept
  * Screen design
  * Concept prototyping
* Build
  * Design & dev collaboration
  * Scaling the design team
  * User research


### Definition phase

Analyzed the current state of SportsIllustrated.com, defined the audience, and created product value propositions.

Mission statement: Our mission is to design a focused and sophisticated site where fans will experience SI’s unique point of view and get the sports news they want everyday.

Key KPIs
* Improve website performance
* Increase time spent on site
* Increase return visitors
* Increase new visitors
* Increase recirculation
* Increase ad viewability

#### Stakeholder Interviews

Problems
* Audience: Current audience is older than desired, visits disproportionately through the home page, and believes SI.com is a mirror of the magazine content
* Content: Maximize video consumption
* Presentation: Improve reading experience and navigation

Product Value Proposition: SportsIllustrated.com is a fast, focused, and sophisticated experience dedicated to passionate sports fans who want timely sports content with valued insight and a unique point of view.

#### Interface concepts

Through a series a design workshops, Moment led the charge creating a series of concepts.

#### Screen design



#### Typography
As a content heavy site, one of the most important areas of exploration was around the choice of typefaces. The most important pieces of info:
* Robust opentype features for the body font
* Tabular number support for tables


### Build phase
After Moment's 12-week engagement with us ended, it was now time to turn our attention to building out the system.

Top-of-mind for me was how to create a more collaborative environment between the engineering and design team. So I decided to run a series of workshops to jumpstart the process.

#### Design & Dev Collaboration

* Performance budgets
* Naming conventions
* Living style guide
* Content modeling

#### Design Reviews
Also as a design team, we traditionally have been silo'ed on projects, often with only two of us working together. So in order to better facilitate communication among a team of four, I decide to implement a more formal critique process, borrowing from several sources for inspiration.

#### User Research
Also, critically important to me was getting the interface prototypes in front of customers as soon as possible. It was one of the fatal flaws of the 2014 redesign of Sports Illustrated. It was first tested after 5-months of high fidelity design and prototyping had been invested into the product, and after testing poorly, the results weren't acted upon because there wasn't any willingness from the highest levels to change course at this point in the process. Having been a part of many projects where usability testing was consistently one of the first casualties in order to meet a launch date, I decided to put together a deck for my team and stakeholders, explaining the importance of early and often usability testing.

</div>


As for the right cadence of testing, I struck inspiration from Jake Knapp and decided to set up a monthly recurring usability testing day. So far we have run 2 tests to date.

We used the proto-personas to inform our recruitment screeners. And I applied the sticky note taking process outlined in the Sprint book in order to increase the stickiness of the takeaways from the sessions.
