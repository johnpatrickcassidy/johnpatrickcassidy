    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Sports Illustrated’s rich 53-year history was locked away behind a rushed, search-gated product that placed undue burden on of users.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Completely revamp <a href="http://www.si.com/vault">the Vault</a> to bring delight and serendipity back into the experience, allowing people to both rediscover their favorite stories and uncover new classics — an experience that would resonate with our lifelong subscribers and a new generation of sports fans alike.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Cover Wall</h5>
      <p class="description">Sports Illustrated's covers capture some of the most iconic moments in sports from the last half century. We made sure covers were central to the Vault experience.</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h5 class="example">Data Informed Design</h5>
      <p class="description">After looking through Vault search data, I found that search terms were falling into one of two main categories: searches for teams and searches for players. Using this data, we decided to  pre-seed some of these terms when the search field was focused to give people ideas of where to begin diving into the Vault.</p>

      <p class="description">As the lead UX designer on the project, I introduced the team to styles tiles and personas as complementary discover methods to uncover unique visual explorations and user flows throughout a person's Vault experience.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Prototyping Screen Flow</h5>
      <p class="description">I decided to experiment with our internal stakeholder review process, attempting to infuse it with new life by presenting <a href="https://invis.io/ZT7LMDN42#/97620930_FullIssues-landing-all">screen flow prototypes</a> instead of static comps. The immediacy of interacting with these wireframes on a device helped to prevent reviews from devolving into backseat pixel pushing. Instead, we began to have more meaningful conversations about the end-to-end experience and how we could focus our energies on creating as seamless and as delightful an experience as possible.</p>
