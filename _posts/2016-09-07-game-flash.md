    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Wanting to reclaim ground as a leading sports news destination, SI sought to improve the second screen experience in order to showcase the brand as more than just (quickly out-of-date) magazine live scoring and play updates that keep users up to the minute on their favorite teams</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Design and develop mobile-first game coverage by bringing two of America’s most popular sports, football and baseball, to life with fun and useful visualizations while events unfolded on the field.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Cover Wall</h5>
      <p class="description">Sports Illustrated's covers capture some of the most iconic moments in sports from the last half century. We made sure covers were central to the Vault experience.</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h5 class="example">Data Informed Design</h5>
      <p class="description">After looking through Vault search data, I found that search terms were falling into one of two main categories: searches for teams and searches for players. Using this data, we decided to  pre-seed some of these terms when the search field was focused to give people ideas of where to begin diving into the Vault.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Style Tiles and Personas</h5>
      <p class="description">As the lead UX designer on the project, I introduced the team to styles tiles and personas as complementary discover methods to uncover unique visual explorations and user flows throughout a person's Vault experience.</p>
