    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Wanting to reclaim ground as a leading sports news destination, SI sought to improve the second screen experience in order to showcase the brand as more than just (quickly out-of-date) magazine live scoring and play updates that keep users up to the minute on their favorite teams</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Design and develop mobile-first game coverage by bringing two of America’s most popular sports, football and baseball, to life with fun and useful visualizations while events unfolded on the field.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Studying the Tape</h5>
      <p class="description">One of the trickest aspects of recreating a live game experience is accounting for all the edge cases and quirks that occur during the course of play. In order to design a robust experience, I immersed myself in both the sports data APIs as well as spending a good deal of time watching the experience unfold alongside live video footage of the event.</p>

      <h5 class="example">High Fidelity Prototypes & User Research</h5>
      <p class="description">I knew early and often usability testing was crucial to a successful product. At the same time, it was very important to us that the prototype feel as rich and as real as the end product. So I turned to <a href="https://framerjs.com/">Framer</a> to create a high fidelity prototype, which you can grab <a href="../assets/prototypes/mlbGameFlashPrototype.framer">here</a> (specifically scaled for the iPhone 5s that was used during testing).</p>

      <h5 class="example">Style Tiles and Personas</h5>
      <p class="description">As the lead UX designer on the project, I introduced the team to styles tiles and personas as complementary discover methods to uncover unique visual explorations and user flows throughout a person's Vault experience.</p>
