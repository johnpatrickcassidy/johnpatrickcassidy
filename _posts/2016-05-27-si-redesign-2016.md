# Backstory

On August 16, 1954, Time Inc took a risk and added a new magazine title into its portfolio. Titled Sports Illustrated, it's mission was to cover the "Wonderful World of Sport."

Flash forward 62 years and see a history dotted with milestones. Unforgettable moments forever immortalized on its covers.

Pain, struggle, triumph, defeat. The words of sportsâ€¦the words of our users?!?

*Add a few tweets from frustrated users*

Not only are our users struggling, but our key KPIs were suffering. Sports Illustrated has some of the best sports journalism, but the experience of reading wasn't up to par.








# The Process
On January 12, 2016, the core team gather to begin a full-on redesign of the site. For the next 12 weeks, our team would be working very closely with the fantastic team at [Moment](http://www.momentdesign.com/).
