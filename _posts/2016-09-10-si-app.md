    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>As Sports Illustrated’s website was plague with connectivity and navigation issues that frustrated its core user base, SI did not have a native app for its regular user base to turn; despite being one of the nation’s oldest sports news brands, SI was growing stale and all too commonly identified only for its print magazine rather than its ground-breaking digital content which desperately needed to be propelled into 21st century digital age.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>SI’s first foray into a mobile app sought to spotlight ground-breaking SI content while creating new opportunities for user personalization and customized push notifications that catered to the needs and interests of its core user base.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Articles</h5>
      <p class="description">The bread-and-butter of Sports Illustrated is its high quality sports journalism. Combine that with the web's ever-growing social and search traffic patterns, and we really wanted the articles to be constructed from beautiful, readable components.</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h5 class="example">Home page & section fronts</h5>
      <p class="description">Though social & search traffic are increasing, Sports Illustrated still has many loyal users who visit the home page directly. Balancing user needs with editorial flexibility, all while making sure we met business requirements on ad inventory and viewability, became our primary challenge when designing components and layout logic for the home page.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Sports data</h5>
      <p class="description">While Sports Illustrated can't compete with the depth of sports data offered by the likes of ESPN, we know a significant segment of our users seek out scores, standings, and other statistics from us. Our goal was to present the data in as clean and straightforward way as possible.</p>

### Pinned Game and Video Interaction

One of the trickier interactions within the app was the interaction between a pinned event tile and a pinned video tile.

The pinned event tile and pinned video tile posed an interesting challenge. So I decided to hop into a high fidelity prototyping app (ultimately deciding on Pixate) to rapidly try out several directions.  to choreography

### Scoreboard Matrix
Another interesting challenge was coming up with an interface for scoreboards that would support multiple sports across many different states. In order to hone in on a layout the was flexible enough to accommodate the variations but robust enough to handle requirements of each sport, I decide to create a matrix with sports on the Y-axis and event states on the X-axis. This framework allowed me to quickly iterate through layout options as well as succinctly communicate these choices to the team.
