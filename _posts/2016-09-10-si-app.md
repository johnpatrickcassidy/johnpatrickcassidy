    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>As Sports Illustrated’s website was plagued with connectivity and navigation issues that frustrated its core user base, SI did not have a native app for its regular user base to turn; despite being one of the nation’s oldest sports news brands, SI was growing stale and all too commonly identified only for its print magazine. SI was desperately in need of being propelled into 21st century.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>SI’s first foray into a mobile app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sports-illustrated/id1069012571?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timeinc.si.personalization&hl=en">Android</a> sought to spotlight ground-breaking SI content while creating new opportunities for user personalization and customized push notifications that catered to the needs and interests of its core user base.</p>

      <h5 class="example">Design Co-Lead</h5>
      <p class="description">Along with my design partner in crime, the extraordinarily talented <a href="http://www.niclanzillo.com/">Nic Lanzillo,</a> we tackled (about time I worked in a sport's pun) the user experience flow and interface design. I focused on navigation (divering where necessary to accommodate platform guidelines), the sports data integrations, and high-fidelity prototyping for the more complex interactions.</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h5 class="example">High Fidelity Prototyping</h5>
      <p class="description">One of the trickest interaction design challenges in the app was the pinned game feature, and it's relationship to picture-in-picture video. Since static comps just wouldn't cut it here, I dove into Pixate to explore different directions in real-time on a device. Here's <a href="../assets/prototypes/pipCorners-04.pixate">the final prototype</a> to play around with.</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h5 class="example">Bridging the Engineering Gap</h5>
      <p class="description">I also led our design team's collaboration with our iOS and Android engineers. Due to our organizational structure, these engineers are part of a separate team. In the past, this often led to miscommunication and subpar products, so this time around I made sure to sit with them, check-in regularly, and most importantly, ask for their ideas and feedback as platform experts.</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h5 class="example">Sports Data Deep Dive</h5>
      <p class="description">Concurrently, I worked closely with our other engineering team that was creating a brand new sports data API. Throughout the product design and development process, I made sure to stay in close communication with them as we uncovered and accounted for all the sneaky edges cases that happen all too regularly across the major sport and leagues.</p>
