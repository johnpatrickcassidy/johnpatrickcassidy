### Overview
In March 2008, Sports Illustrated debuted the Vault, bringing the 53-year history of the brand into the digital world. It launched to [some fanfare](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/media/17mags.html?_r=0) and brought with it some significant traffic, peaking in July 2009 with 2.7 million unique visitors, and goodwill among loyal and new users alike. However, over time, with it's appeal and traffic (declining steadily 27% YoY) waning, it's feature set was significantly reduced when SI.com relaunched in June 2014. The entire experience became "search-gated," a term we lovingly coined to describe the burden now placed on people to know precisely what they were looking for. Some people shared their frustration.

So we decided to do something about it.

### Research
While it widely understood within the company that the Vault was underperforming, I wanted to ensure our team and stakeholders remained user-focused throughout the entire product development process. To do so, I conducted a series of interviews with a few of our former Vault editors and surfaced user research and analytics from over the years. As useful as this type of research is, I really wanted to drive home the importance of a human-centered approach to the Vault's redesign.

On past projects, I struggled to convince our stakeholders of the importance of personas. This time around I was determined to change that. I knew that I had to somehow make to make these personas feel more real.

I then led the team through the process of creating proto-personas.



  One exercise that I found particularly helpful in making our proto-personas come to life.  was searching through Twitter and blog posts (and their comments sections) to discover real people who were sharing their favorite Sports Illustrated memories and stories.
